        <h1>Project Overview</h1>
        <p>
          At CareerFoundry, I was tasked with designing a native mobile app for
          both Android and iOS platforms. This was an open project, so I decided
          to do a redesign of a little known app, “The Hiker's Logbook”.
        </p>
        <h2>Context</h2>
        <p>
          The original version of the app is unappealing both visually and
          functionally. Its core purpose is solid, but needs to grow to stand
          out in a crowded market. Hikers love to journal their adventures and
          want more intuitive platforms to relive their treks.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="role">
        <h1>My Role</h1>
        <h2>Goal:</h2>
        <p>
          The overall goal of this redesign was to attract more users by making
          it more appealing to all hikers, not just thru-hikers. Growth and
          becoming more competitive in the long-term was the focus. To achieve
          this, there were problems I needed to find solutions for.

        <h2>Problems:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Existing UI lacking visual appeal</li>
          <li>Target audience too narrowed</li>
          <li>
            Lacking expanded features that will appeal to a wider audience.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Solutions:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Improve the UI design</li>
          <li>
            Implement more interactive journaling features for added user
            interaction
          </li>
          <li>
            Implement related app functions as this will assure users aren't
            overwhelmed and the app purpose won't get lost
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>My Tasks:</h2>

          <li>Product Research</li>

        <h1>My Process</h1>
        <h2>Product Research</h2>
        <p>
          The first step was understand the direction of the app redesign. This
          involved researching similar apps on the market, their design
          patterns, behavior and features.

            <li>Easy to follow navigation</li>
            <li>Recording feature is intuitive and simple</li>
            <li>Accessibility and every element has a place or purpose</li>

        <h2>User Flow</h2>
        <p>
          The user flow chart is rarely final on the first draft for me as it
          takes fine tuning throughout the UX and UI design process. This
          insures that the user experience is always the priority for a seamless
          experience.

        <h2>Wireframes</h2>
        <p>
          Originally built on findings of the product research and my user
          flows, these laid the ground work for the final structure of the app.
          Often times I come up with better solutions later in the process, so
          revisions on these are quite common.
        </p>

        </picture>
        <h2>User Testing</h2>
        <p>
          I tested a series of prototypes of high fidelity wireframes I created.
          This is where the solutions I was presenting was validated or showed
          need for improvement. Valuable information was collected to refine my
          designs until a final prototype of the end result could be produced.
        </p>
        <div>
          <h3>Test Takeaways</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              There were missed screen and component states in test, confusing
              testers. /li>
            </li>
            <li>
              I needed to up my Figma prototyping skills to efficiently deliver
              a test friendly prototype
            </li>
            <li>
              There was a feeling that there were un-needed gestures and
              elements on screen as this caused confusion during steps. Thus
              creating a need for more simplicity. I learned less is more here.
            </li>
            <li>
              The added features were validated as it appeared to spark interest
              with testers
            </li>
            <li>
              The UI design up to this point was strong and added appeal for
              users
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <h2>UI Design</h2>
        <p>
          I started the process by looking for inspiration. I studied everything
          outdoor and hiking related. I went with the earth tones you'd expect
          and a vibrant green shade to give the app some pop. I was sure that
          the primary and active states had the bright green to gain attention
          from the users. The guidelines for each platform were carefully
          incorporated, but at the same time I aimed for continuity between the
          two version.
        </p>

          />
          <img src="img/hikers-logbook/ui-design-1-large.png" />
        </picture>
        <h2>Final Prototype</h2>
        <p>
          Testers were frustrated that they couldn't start the hike at any given
          time. They also felt that too much was provided to them outside the
          primary task. My solution intended for the users to fill out the form
          before starting the hike. My solution to this was disabling the map
          and recording controls until the form task was complete. This resulted
          in the users focus being narrowed down to completing the form first.
          This solution provided a more streamlined flow that ended with more
          success. I applied the same approach app wide. Attached is the Android
          version of the prototype.

        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>
          I've learned so much about the prototyping during the project. Going
          forward I will think about the different states I have to design for
          when I'm working on my initial mockups. Having these states fully
          designed for in this stage will also prevent the time crunch I felt
          this time around. I've also learned valuable lessons on how to
          prototype effectively in Figma, by utilizing more component and layer
          animations.
